# 🛡️ Super Knight

**Super Knight** is a 2D platformer made in **Godot 4.2**, inspired by Super Mario. It began as a tutorial project, but I added my own features like enemy defeat, scene transitions , coin collection, multiple levels, and level endpoints.

This was one of my first Godot projects and a great way to learn 2D game development.
